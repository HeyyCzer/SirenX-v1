> The ultimate `carcols.meta` lighting pattern editor

SirenX is a free and open-source website that allows you to edit `carcols.meta` sirens (lighting patterns) of your emergency vehicles or similars.

This is the best way to save a lot of time and mental health (ha-ha) to make silly changes like changing the way a vehicle lights on your server flash.
